Nasa Space Apps 2024 Project a 3D VR game for Glactic Games Challange
Our project is a game developed for the challenge "Galactic Games: Fun in Microgravity Environments." The game tells the story of an astronaut who takes a pill, leaving his body behind. The player controls the astronaut's spirit, which must navigate a series of puzzles and challenges designed around the principles of microgravity. These challenges involve physics-based mechanics that reflect the unique movement and problem-solving constraints of a zero-gravity environment. What did we develop? We created a puzzle-adventure game that incorporates realistic microgravity physics, where the player must solve spatial puzzles, navigate floating objects, and overcome various obstacles to reunite with their body. How does it address the challenge? The challenge required creating fun, engaging gameplay in microgravity conditions. Our game leverages the absence of gravity as a core mechanic. It highlights the differences in movement, object interaction, and puzzle solving when traditional forces like friction and gravity are absent. This ensures the player experiences and learns about the real constraints of movement in space while having fun. Why is it important? This project not only provides entertainment but also introduces players to the dynamics of microgravity, making it an educational experience. It encourages problem-solving, creativity, and adaptability in unfamiliar environments, concepts that are crucial in real-life space exploration. By addressing the microgravity challenge in a fun and interactive way, our game helps foster interest in space science and physics.
Game Contains six scenes (Main-Menu, Intro-Room, RoomOne, RoomTwo, RoomThree, Closing Scene)
Connect your VR to the laptop and open Meta app when you enter play mode you will find the game working perfectly
